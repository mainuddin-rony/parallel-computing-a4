Solve the 2D shallow-water equations with a finite-volume scheme.
A Riemann solver is used.

This is a small prototype, with a custom OpenGL visualization (a bit buggy).
It allows to generate waves and simulate water drops in a bathtub.

The final result is available [on Youtube](http://youtu.be/Syvi0RdXF6A).
